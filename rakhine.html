									<div class="image fit flush"><img src="images/r1.jpg" alt="" ></div>
									<p>The first month of Myanmar calendar year is pronounced as Da Gu La in spoken language, however if we strictly adhere to the literal pronunciation(according to its spelling) it should be pronounced as Tan Khu La as it writes wefcl;v. In many cases in Myanmar Language pronunciation does not follow the general rule “To pronounce as it writes” This is a lovely peculiarity of Myanmar language.
											Tan Khu La is the time when Myanmar pick the fruit from toddy palm. Fruit of toddy palm bears the name “Htan”in Myanmar. Pick is represented by Myanmar word “Khu.” So, “Htan Khu” may be the origin and corrupted to “Tan Khu” in later time. “La” is “month” in English. According to one source it was noted “Tar Ku” was used in Ava Period bearing the meaning the “change from old to new year”
											When we say Da Gu La, every Myanmar people know new year is coming with immediate preceding of water festival (Thingyan in Myanmar language) for three or four days in which all the citizens regardless of race and religion participate and enjoy.</p>

								<h3>Rakhine Traditional Water Festival (Thingyan)</h3>
							<p>Almost all indigenous ethnic groups celebrate the Thingyan in Da Gu La, but with trace of their own tradition and social mores. Rakhine people also have their own new year water festival (Thingyan) which is the most noteworthy of all traditional festivals of Rakhine. Traditional activities of Rakhine Thingyan are marked by making the paste of scented wood like Thanakha (Limonia acidissima) or Sandal wood, sacred bathing of the images of Buddha, washing hair of old women by young ladies, keeping Sabbath, doing charity deeds, paying homage to the elderly persons and participating in water dousing celebration. In some places some of the above mentioned activities become less pronounced and in some places they have disappeared.<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
Before sacred bathing the Buddha Images, young men and ladies gather at an appropriate place of village or ward and grind the sandal woods on the specially designed stone slabs with smooth surface. Rakhine traditional music troupe comprising Rakhine youngsters are playing the music with Rakhine Thingyan songs and antiphonal chants in loud chorus encouraging and entertaining the ladies at their labor in grinding the sandal wood. People around are also participating in the joyful event. The paste of sandal wood is collected in silver bowls and kept at a monastery or a religious congregation hall. The sandal wood paste is used in the collective sacred bathing of Buddha Images, stupas and shrines next day. Only after the completion of sacred bathing events, people are dousing each other with the spirit of washing the sin and sinister influence out of the body before the new year comes.</span></p>

<p>	
Tha tradition of sacred bathing Buddha images was known to have started since the era of 3rd Danyawaddy. During 3dr Danyawaddy era at BC580 Sandar Thuria took the throne and at BC 554, 12 years after his coronation he came to know that Gottama had attained enlightenment and became Buddha in Myitzima land in the west (now Nepal). He strongly desired to see Buddha and according to the advice of his counsellors he vowed and implored Buddha in his spiritually resolute mind to do him a favour of visiting Danyawaddy. The Buddha complying with the king’s request came to Danyawaddy together with 500 Sangha retinues and delivered sermons on Buddhism. Before Buddha and his entourage left for home the king Sandar Thuria had his men cast a Bronze image of Buddha on full moon of Kason La 123 Myanmar Year and finished on 1st waning moon of Kason La. The king named the bronze image Maha Muni.The king had it consecrated by Buddha himself and let the people pour the scented water on the image. Then, people poured the scented water on each other. Thus came the tradition of water pouring festival in Rakhine, and Rakhine people celebrate the water festival only after the sacred bathing of Buddha Images.
</p>						
<p>
Rakhine communities are widespread throughout in Myanmar. They are celebrating their traditional Rakhine Thingyan. It is very important to uphold our own tradition and also to respect the tradition of other indigenous people. We, all the people in Myanmar regardless of race and religion should avoid activities and behaviors that blight the Thingyan of auspicious Myanmar New Year. All the ethnic people should embellish Da Gu La by Thingyan Festivals with national identity tinted with their own traditions and culture. Please be cautious to not make the Thingyan an ugly occasion.
