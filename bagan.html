								<p><b>Thingyan, or the Myanmar Water Festival, takes place toward the end of the hot, dry season and ushers in the Myanmar New Year. Thingyan is a huge, country wide celebration. It is without a doubt the most unique and colourful  merriest occasion in Myanmar.

Officially Thingyan takes place from 13-16 of April. Generally speaking the water part of the festival lasts for 3 – 5 days depending on which part of the country you are in.

Thingyan is a similar celebration as Songkran in Thailand and Laos, Chaul Chnam Thmey in Cambodia.Everyone. The rich. The poor. The monks. The paper boys. The cane sugar juice merchants. Almost everyone gets in on the celebration, with many people opting to go home to their villages to celebrate.

We only came across a handful of people who were not with their families celebrating. These were a few taxi drivers, capitalising the holiday with surge pricing, and quite a few very junior police and army officers on patrol.

Thingyan is the only time of year when rank, title and status mean next to nothing. We partied on the back of trucks with army folks, teenage girls and just about anyone that was willing to help me up onto the back of their Jeep. It’s a truly wonderful time for people to put aside political belief and just party.</b></p>

<p><b>Today, Thingyan is celebrated all over Myanmar. Every city, town and village celebrates Thingyan. This is the event for everyone. Rich and poor alike become the same during Thingyan. This is the time where all social and cultural barriers break down in Myanmar. If you have been to Myanmar before and you already have an idea of what Myanmar people are like, you will find a different aspect of Myanmar life and Myanmar people. You will see the most joyous, fun loving and wildest part of Myanmar people during Thingyan.</b></p>

								<b><p>Bagan is a place of thousands of temples. It was capital of the Kingdom of Pagan between the 9th and 13th centuries, and over 10,000 Buddhist temples and pagoda’s were built in that time, of which over 2000 remain now.Thingyan is actually not a true traditional Burmese custom. It is an imported cultural event, incorporated and extensively modified over several hundred years to become essentially a true Burmese cultural event. The origin of Thingyan can be traced back to India where it is one of the events of Hindi culture. The culture of Thingyan was brought into Burma by many Indian Brahmins who came to Burma to serve in the courts of Burmese kingdoms. As these Indian Brahmins held important positions in the court of Burmese kings, their culture, tradition and believes had great influence on the culture and tradition of Burmese royal courts. Thingyan is one of their cultural influences in the life of Burmese people. The recorded Thingyan in the history of Burma was in Bagan era in the 13th century.<span id="dots">.....</span><span id="more">. Burmese historical accounts described the celebration of Thingyan in the royal court of Bagan. In one event, the king of Bagan, Nara Thiha Pathae ordered the ladies of his royal court to throw water at one of his wives to soak. Taking this as an act of humiliation, the wife took her revenge by plotting assassination against the king. However, the assassination plot was found out and the wife, together with all her relatives, was executed by burning alive. This is the earliest record of Thingyan in Burmese history.The background of Thingyan is the celebration of the Burmese New Year (which actually is a modification of Indian calendar). Burmese New Year falls during the month of April. Every year, the Brahmins of The Burmese Calendar Committee advised on the government to the date of the Burmese New Year day. Thingyan is celebrated for three days prior to the New Year day. However, in certain years, Thingyan is celebrated for four days. The number of days is calculated by the Brahmins of the Calendar Committee.
